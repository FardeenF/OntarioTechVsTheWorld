# Game Engine Final GDW Project
## Project Description
For this assignment, we decided to use design and optimization patterns such as
Observer, Dirty Flag, Object Pooling, and decoupling/ event queue. On top of this, we
added 2 DLLs. One DLL is for language translation in our main menu and the other
toggles a half-tone effect canvas overlay.

## Game Description
Ontario Tech vs The World is a volumetric fighting game based in a comic book world at Ontario Tech University. The old Hunter Ridgeback mascot is jealous of the new Hunter Ridgeback and brainwashes the teachers in order to take over the school. It is your job to fight your way to victory and take back the school!
